"""Chunk-causal MiniMax H3 DiT: state-dict-neutral subclasses of the official model.

Scope (M2)
----------
This implementation currently models **text rows plus target (video + audio)
rows**; condition rows -- the ones reference (``ref2va``) and keyframe
(``fl2va``) conditioning add -- are not implemented, and neither is CFG,
batch > 1, multi-GPU, sequence/FSDP parallelism or any training path. That is
the coverage of this causal lane, not a claim about the RAVEN LoRA or the
official H3 model. What lands here is the *causal lane*: a text prefill, a
per-chunk forward against a KV cache, and nothing else. The sampler (M3) drives
it; no node, no sampler and no web code lives here.

Three classes, each a subclass of its official counterpart in
``comfy.ldm.minimax.model``:

``RavenCausalAttention(Attention)``
    Same parameters, same names, same shapes -- ``layer_idx`` is a plain int,
    not a module. QKV projection, per-head RMSNorm and *absolute* RoPE are the
    official ones (including the fused ``rms_rope_split_half`` kernel), then the
    retained cached K/V are assembled in front of this chunk's own K/V -- one
    merged buffer per layer, filled in place by the cache (see "The merged
    slot" below) -- while Q stays current-only. Attention itself is ``mask``-free: the current chunk
    is fully visible inside itself and fully attends to whatever the cache
    retained, which is exactly the visibility RAVEN's training mask encodes for
    a non-diagonal chunk. Cached keys keep the absolute positions they were
    rotated with, so no re-basing is ever needed.

``RavenCausalDiTBlock(DiTBlock)``
    The official block with ``self.attn`` swapped for the causal one. Same
    module keys, same norm / AdaLN / gate / MLP order -- the forward body is a
    verbatim fork with the cache kwargs threaded through.

``RavenCausalMiniMaxH3Model(MiniMaxH3Model)``
    The official model, whose 50 blocks are rebuilt as causal blocks after
    construction (one at a time, so peak memory stays at one extra block). The
    state dict is unchanged, key for key and shape for shape -- construction
    asserts it. The inherited dense ``forward``/``_forward`` keeps working (the
    causal kwargs default to "no cache"), and two explicit APIs are added:
    :meth:`prefill_text` and :meth:`forward_chunk`.

Two lanes, one state dict
-------------------------
Everything here is dual-path, and the switch is **the cache**:

* ``cache is None`` -- the *dense* lane. Every forward body defers to its
  official parent (``super().forward``, ``AdalnProj.forward``,
  ``FinalLayer.forward``, ``optimized_attention``, ``TokenRefiner.forward``),
  so the inherited dense ``forward``/``_forward`` stays bit-identical to
  upstream. ``tests/test_causal_model_parity.py`` pins that.
* ``cache is not None`` -- the *causal* lane, which reproduces **RAVEN's**
  numerical order rather than Comfy's, because the checkpoint and the LoRA were
  trained through RAVEN's operators. The four places the two implementations
  disagree, all measured on a real CUDA BF16 single-block audit:

  ``attention``
      RAVEN hands packed ``[rows, heads, dim]`` q/k/v to
      ``utils.flash_attn.FlashAttention``, which dispatches **FlashAttention 3,
      then FlashAttention 2, then a packed SDPA fallback**. Comfy's
      ``optimized_attention`` instead dispatches a 4-D
      ``[1, heads, rows, dim]`` call through whichever backend its build picked
      (relative L2 0.0024-0.0028 against RAVEN).
      :func:`raven_packed_attention` is the RAVEN path, single document,
      batch 1, same priority chain -- see "Attention backend" below.
  ``AdaLN input``
      RAVEN computes ``silu(t_emb)`` **in fp32** once per forward and casts the
      result to the compute dtype; ``AdalnProj.forward`` runs the SiLU at the
      module dtype, i.e. on an already-rounded BF16 ``t_emb`` (0.0035-0.0052).
      The causal lane therefore builds the shared ``adaln_input`` itself and
      calls ``adaln_proj.linear`` directly -- ``apply_silu`` is never mutated,
      because that flag is also read by the dense lane.
  ``gate``
      RAVEN's ``_modulate_gate`` is out of place, ``(x + gate * other).to(dt)``,
      rounding the product before the sum; Comfy's ``_mod_gate`` fuses them
      into ``addcmul_`` (0.000886). :func:`_raven_mod_gate` is the RAVEN form.
  ``text refiner``
      Same attention split as above, so :meth:`prefill_text` replays the
      refiner block body over the official modules.

  Everything else -- qkv GEMM, QK norm, RoPE, the AdaLN GEMM, scale/shift, the
  SwiGLU MLP -- was measured **bit-identical** and is left alone: the causal
  lane keeps calling the official modules and the official
  ``_mod_scale_shift``.

Every weight is still reached through its module's ``__call__``. That is not
style: :mod:`raven_streaming.runtime_linear` attaches the RAVEN LoRA as a
``register_forward_hook`` on each ``Linear``, and ComfyUI's partial offload
casts weights inside ``forward``. Touching ``.weight`` directly, or calling
``module.forward(...)``, would silently drop the adapter and read an offloaded
tensor.

Attention backend
-----------------
A strict vr audit settled what the remaining attention gap actually is. Once
both sides were forced onto the *same* math SDPA with
``allow_fp16_bf16_reduction_math_sdp(False)``, every stage -- refiner, DiT
blocks, embeddings -- came out **bit-identical**. So the production difference
was never the operator order: it was that RAVEN runs an external varlen
**FlashAttention 3** kernel while this lane ran PyTorch SDPA.

:func:`raven_packed_attention` therefore reproduces RAVEN's dispatch, not just
its fallback:

1. ``flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_varlen_func`` (FA3), then
2. ``flash_attn.flash_attn_varlen_func`` (FA2), then
3. PyTorch SDPA, the packed transcription of ``utils.flash_attn._sdpa_varlen``.

The first two are used only on CUDA, only for fp16/bf16, only for
``head_dim <= 256`` -- RAVEN's own assertions -- and are called with RAVEN's
exact keyword set (``cu_seqlens_q``/``cu_seqlens_k`` built by the same cumsum,
``max_seqlen_q``/``max_seqlen_k``, ``softmax_scale``, ``causal=False``,
``deterministic=False``, FA2's ``dropout_p=0.0`` and ``window_size=(-1, -1)``,
FA3's ``seqused_q=None``/``seqused_k=None``). Nothing is imported from RAVEN;
the two packages are imported directly, lazily, and cached.

``FLASH_ATTN_3_AVAILABLE=0`` / ``FLASH_ATTN_2_AVAILABLE=0`` disable a backend,
exactly as they do in RAVEN, which is how a parity run pins both sides to the
same kernel.

The SDPA step is where the vr finding is honoured: it saves
``fp16_bf16_reduction_math_sdp_allowed()``, turns the reduction off **for that
one call**, and restores it in ``finally`` -- including on exception -- so a
Comfy-wide setting is never left changed.

What may fall back and what may not is a deliberate line. A missing package, a
disabled env switch, an unmet precondition, or a kernel that says it does not
support this build/shape (see :func:`_unsupported_reason`) fall back and are
recorded. Anything else -- OOM, a CUDA fault, an assertion from inside the
kernel -- propagates: swallowing it would silently change the numbers that this
whole module exists to keep. :func:`raven_attention_backend` reports what was
resolved and what the last call actually ran.

The merged slot
---------------
A cached layer needs ``[retained | current]`` keys and values on the compute
device, and nothing else. It gets them as **one** allocation:
:meth:`ChunkKVCache.retained_spec` says how many rows the history is,
``k.new_empty((past + rows, heads, head_dim))`` reserves the merged pair, and
:meth:`ChunkKVCache.copy_retained_into` writes the retained rows straight into
the prefix while this chunk's own rows are copied into the tail.

The old spelling -- ``torch.cat((cache.retained(...), k))`` -- allocated the
gathered history *and* the merge, so two device buffers were live at the peak;
with the cache's canonical copy on the host it would have been three. The
assembly API removes both extra buffers, which is what makes a host-side KV
cache cost one merged slot of device memory at a time instead of the whole
history. The values and the layout are unchanged: contiguous, row-major,
retained rows first, exactly what ``cat`` produced and what RAVEN's own scatter
produces.

A layer with **no** history allocates nothing: ``k`` stays the freshly
materialised contiguous tensor and ``v`` stays the fused-QKV view, which is
RAVEN's no-history layout (see the stride note in
:meth:`RavenCausalAttention.forward`).

The path is the same for every ``storage`` the cache was built with -- a
device-resident cache copies device-to-device into the same prefix -- so
``gpu``, ``cpu_pinned`` and ``cpu`` are bit-for-bit the same rollout, and only
the residency and the bandwidth differ.

Timestep convention
-------------------
The sampler side speaks the RAVEN repo convention: ``t_repo = sigma``, so
``t_repo = 0`` is clean. This module converts at its boundary:

* a **noise** chunk carries its own ``sigma`` per stream (video and audio run
  independent shifted grids) and maps to H3 time ``t_h3 = 1 - sigma``;
* a **clean** chunk (context written into the cache) maps to
  ``t_h3 = 0.999`` -- the checkpoint's attested condition timestep -- and its
  rows are re-noised as ``t * x0 + (1 - t) * eps`` per stream, with ``eps``
  supplied by the caller so a later pass can reproduce the exact context;
* text is prefilled alone at the same ``0.999``, never merged with media rows.

Every one of those numbers is evaluated in **float32**, because RAVEN evaluates
them in float32 (see :func:`_fp32_one_minus`): ``t_h3 = 1 - sigma`` is an fp32
subtraction, the condition constant is the fp32 ``0.999``, and the mix's eps
coefficient is ``1 - fp32(0.999) = 0.00099998713``, *not* ``fp32(0.001)``. The
sigma schedule itself is untouched -- only the conversion at this boundary.

Distinct timesteps become distinct ``t_emb`` rows, and each row expands to the
official three AdaLN modality rows (video 0, text 1, audio 2), so the AdaLN
semantics are the dense model's.

Returned velocity
-----------------
:meth:`forward_chunk` returns the **native H3 velocity** ``v = x0 - eps`` for
the chunk's own rows, i.e. the raw head output. The official dense ``forward``
returns ``-v`` (Comfy's sampler convention); the causal lane deliberately does
not negate, because the RAVEN consistency step consumes H3 velocity directly.
:func:`velocity_to_x0` is the matching conversion.

It is returned in **fp32**, in the head's own dtype, and is *not* rounded back
to the latent's. That is the checkpoint's contract, not a preference:
``FinalLayer.video_out``/``audio_out`` are built ``dtype=torch.float32``
("the checkpoint's fp32 island", upstream's words) exactly like
``video_patch_proj``/``audio_patch_proj`` and the time embedder, and RAVEN's
``MiniMaxH3FinalLayer`` does the same -- it casts the modulated activations up
with ``h.to(_FP32_DTYPE)`` and both heads are ``params_dtype=_FP32_DTYPE``.
RAVEN's ``MiniMaxH3X0Model.forward`` then converts velocity to ``x0`` in fp32
(``minimax_h3_rf_v_to_x0`` on the fp32 logits) and never rounds in between.

This used to be ``velocity.to(video_latent.dtype)``. With a ComfyUI ``LATENT``
(fp32) that cast was a no-op, which is why it survived; with a **BF16** latent
-- what the parity harness runs, and what a BF16 ``LATENT`` would be -- it put
one bf16 ULP of *relative* error (2**-9, ~1.7e-3) on every value the sampler
consumes. It was the last measurable difference against the RAVEN harness once
the operators and the attention backend matched: with the cast, per-chunk
``video_x0`` sat at rel_l2 1.67e-3; without it, **0.0** (audio 1.2e-8, fp32
noise from the permute). ``unpatchify_video`` and ``unpack_audio`` are pure
reshape/permute, so nothing between the head and the caller changes a bit.

What crosses into fp32 is therefore only the *output* side: the velocity, the
sampler's ``x0``/``x_t`` transition arithmetic, and the latent it finally
delivers. The model's own compute stays in the compute dtype -- the packed rows,
the blocks, and the cached K/V are all BF16 -- and the next chunk's embedding
steps re-enter through ``patchify_video(x.to(torch.float32))`` /
``pack_audio``, i.e. the fp32 patch projections the production dense forward
uses too, whose output is cast back to the compute dtype before the blocks. An
fp32 latent arriving from the sampler is therefore what those projections
already expect; a BF16 one is silently upcast by the same line.

Inference only
--------------
:meth:`prefill_text` and :meth:`forward_chunk` run under ``torch.no_grad``:
RAVEN's rollout is a no-grad path, upstream's fused in-place RoPE kernel refuses
autograd outright, and a backward through a cached forward would recompute the
cache merge against an already-advanced cache.
